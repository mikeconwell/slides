### Question 15
#### Hot air balloons rise into the air because the density of the air (warmer air) inside the balloon is less dense than the air outside the balloon (cooler air). The balloon and the basket displaces a fluid that is heavier than the balloon and the basket, so it has a buoyant force acting on the system. Name this physics principle. 
<span style="display:none;visibility:hidden;">Archimedes Principle</span>

---

## Name of hybrid balloon that has a separate cell for a lighter than air gas as well as a cone below for hot air?
<span style="display:none;visibility:hidden;">Roziere </span>

---

### Question 17
## Name the largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world?
<span style="display:none;visibility:hidden;">Cameron Balloons, Bristol, UK
(includes Lindstrand, Thunder and Colt)<br />Second largest is Ultramagic in Spain</span>

---

### Question 18
## Under which atmospheric conditions is balloon lift off and climb the most difficult?
- a. Low temperature and low humidity
- b. High temperature and low humidity
- c. High temperature and high humidity
<span style="display:none;visibility:hidden;">c. High temperature and high humidity </span>

---

### Question 19
## These two guys completed the first round-the-world hot air balloon flight. Name them.
<span style="display:none;visibility:hidden;"> Bertran Piccard (Switzerland) and Brian Jones (Great Britain) </span>
- When? 
<span style="display:none;visibility:hidden;">March 20, 1999
 </span>

---

### Question 20
## In 1999, the Texas Legislature designated which Texas city as the Hot Air Balloon Capital of Texas? 
<span style="display:none;visibility:hidden;">Plano </span>

---

### Question 21
### In hot air balloons, propane is preferred to butane or other hydrocarbons because:
- a. It is less volatile
- b. It is slower to vaporize
- c. It has a lower boiling point
<span style="display:none;visibility:hidden;">a. It is less volatile </span>

---

### Question 22
### While flying in 64&deg;F / 18&deg;C air, ice begins forming on the outside of the fuel tank in use but not on the reserve tank. This would most likely be caused by:
- a. Water in the fuel
- b. A leak in the fuel line
- c. Vaporized fuel instead of liquid fuel being drawn from the tank into the main burner.
<span style="display:none;visibility:hidden;">c. Vaporized fuel ... drawn from the tank... </span>

---

### Question 23
### What condition does a rising barometer indicate for balloon operations?
- a. Decreasing clouds and wind
- b. Chances of thunderstorms
- c. Approaching frontal activity
<span style="display:none;visibility:hidden;">a. Decreasing clouds and wind</span>

---

### Question 24
### It may be possible to make changes in the direction of flight in a hot air balloon by
- a. Flying a constant atmospheric pressure gradient
- b. Operating at different flight altitudes
- c. Operating above the friction level if there is no gradient wind.
<span style="display:none;visibility:hidden;">b. Operating at different flight altitudes</span>
